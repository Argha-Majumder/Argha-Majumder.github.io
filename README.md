# Alarm Clock Project

The idea for this project is to provide user with an interactive alarm clock.

The alarm clock features a digital clock based on user's location and the user is able to select multiple time for 
the alarm to go off and can set or cancel the alarm.

When the set alarm is reached it will alert the user and if the user wants to give the alarm a valid name it also has
that functionality too.
